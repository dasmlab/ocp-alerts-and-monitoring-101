# Step 1: No ServiceMonitor
# At this stage, the pod will come up and show "I'm not started yet" on the webpage
# This demonstrates that we can reach the POD but it's not happy yet
# 
# To demonstrate:
# 1. Deploy the app: oc apply -f deployment.yaml
# 2. Port-forward to the service: oc port-forward -n demo-app svc/demo-app 8080:8080
# 3. Open http://localhost:8080/ - you should see "I'm not started yet"
# 4. Check that Prometheus is NOT scraping this app yet (no ServiceMonitor)

# No ServiceMonitor exists at this step
